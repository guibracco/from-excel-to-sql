# from-excel-to-sql
SQL Learning Project for the Data Analysis and Infrastucture Module at the Data Analyst Program - Hyper Island - Stockholm. Cleaning and converting an Excel-based database to SQL.

We have been tasked with transitioning a spreadsheet based data set to a relational database.
For that, we used the MSSQL server.
The steps included reviewing the data, designing the tables and thinking about the best way of relating them, cleaning the data, connecting the data and populating the database.
